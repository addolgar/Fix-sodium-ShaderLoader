# Fix sodium ShaderLoader
 
There is some time I made [a PR](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/pull/3132) to fix nvidium and voxy to being able to load shaders in sodium on neoforge (on fabric it's not necessary see the pr for more details), it have been merge and it have been sometime. Because sodium 0.6.14 is not released yet, I made this mod to patch sodium 0.6.13 to have the same fix.
